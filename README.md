# EndlessArena
Endless Arena is a text based discord game. Currently very much a work in progress but the end goal is a roguelike style text based game done fully in discord. 
You will create your character with a simple /create command then type /battle to initiate a battle with a random enemy. Upon defeating enemies you will earn xp to level up and gold
that can be used in between battles by typing /shop to purchase weapons and armor (and perhaps some other items like potions) to fight more difficult creatures and progress further into the game. If you die you're dead permanently and will have to start over with a new character from the beginning.
